# Causal Inference and Machine Learning Course 
This course was taught by Professor Alexander Quispe. The general objective of this course was to provide us with the statistical tools for Machine Learning (ML) and Causal Inference methods. The codes that you will find were replicated by Sandra Martinez, Gianfranco Soria and myself. Likewise, you will find the reference codes for each topic in their respective scripts. 

We would also like to thank Professor Alexander Quispe, who has constantly supported and advised us.
